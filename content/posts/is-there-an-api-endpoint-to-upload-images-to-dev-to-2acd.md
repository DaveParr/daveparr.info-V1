 I'm continuing to work on [
`dev.to.ol`
](https://github.com/DaveParr/dev.to.ol). Some of the [future work](https://github.com/DaveParr/dev.to.ol/projects) is sort of clear to me, but I'm still missing a big piece of the puzzle. 

> How can I take the charts (images) generated by the rendering of the .Rmd, and submit them to dev.to?

I'm not spotting a 
`POST`
 or 
`PUT`
 method in the [api docs](https://docs.dev.to/api/). Have I overlooked something, or is it something that might be a future feature?
