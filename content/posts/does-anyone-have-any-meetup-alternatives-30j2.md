[I found this article on meetup alternatives interesting](https://marcusnoble.co.uk/2019-10-21-meetup-alternatives/). I'm an organiser for [Cardiff R Usergroup](https://www.meetup.com/Cardiff-R-User-Group/), and regularly attend quite a few other events in the city. 

Is meetup common for tech groups where you are? Do you or events you go to use anything different?
