I know we have 
`blogdown`
 and 
`distill`
, which are great for hosting whole sites. We also have the 
`github_document`
 output from 
`knitr`
, which is ok, but a little manual to get something up on the site.

Does anyone know if there is any work being done to publish more effectively to dev.to, or something that I might have missed that is well known?
